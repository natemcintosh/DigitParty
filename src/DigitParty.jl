"""
    play!(g::Game, e::AbstractEngine)

Play a single game with a given engine. Optionally, specify a random number generator.
This can be useful in cases where you want two or more engines to play the exact same
game. The score is returned.

Note that the `Game` object will be filled up. If you want multiple engines to play
the same game, make copies of it with `deepcopy()`.
